## Local installation

To run the game locally, while working on it, just serve the folder with an HTTP server and visit it in the browser to load `index.html`. Here’s one way to do that:

* Clone this GitHub repository, or download the game files. See GitHub or Git help for how to do that.
* Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
* on the command line, run `npm install -g http-server`
* on the command line, `cd` inside the cloned/downloaded game folder, then run `http-server`
* Visit http://localhost:8080/. (`http-server` will suggest the URL http://0.0.0.0:8080/, but 0.0.0.0 doesn’t work on Windows.)
